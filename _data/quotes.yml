- quote: My lady, Kathy, and I moved into our home in Strawberry Flats over 8 years ago. It was the best move we made in our 50 years of marriage – and it was number 13! Kathy passed last year, but we both loved living here and I have no plans to leave. The quality of our home, the ease of living (no maintenance work for me!), the location, the neighbors, are all big pluses; and with the Mosso’s as our caretakers – life here is good. After living in three other apartment complexes in this area, I speak from experience – Strawberry Flats is the best by far.

The apartment complex is very well managed by the Mosso family. They are quick to respond to our needs as they arise. The apartment itself is nicely appointed and comfortable in all seasons. The neighbors are great. We are within minutes of shopping centers, restaurants and recreational opportunities. Life is good here. We hope to stay for many years.

    Once we decided to sell our house and rid ourselves of the headaches of home ownership, we undertook an exhaustive search for alternative living arrangements. One thing that became clear is that the words “Luxury  Apartments” did not always reflect actual conditions. \n
    We did not find success until we viewed the apartments at Strawberry Flats (Sister Apartment Complex). Once we saw them, our search was over. The many positives included quality detail and construction, beautiful hardwood floors and kitchen cabinets, excellent appliances, spacious master bedroom and shower along with exceptional storage space. \n
    The most important factor however was the ease of dealing with the staff of Mosso Realty. Every individual we encountered was professional and friendly and did all they could to remedy the situation in the best interest of the renter.
    We know we made the best decision available allowing us to fulfill our housing needs.

The apartments are beautifully designed, and the Mosso Realty staff is incredibly professional, attentive, and very detail-oriented. The apartment home looked brand new when we moved in, and the staff meticulously maintains the premises. It certainly feels more like a home than an apartment, and the neighborhood is very friendly and quaint. Would highly recommend!

    I remember the early days of this story so clearly… as well as the days and years beyond….. I not only found a residence moving to Strawberry Flats (Sister Apartment Complex), I found a home. This is how it all began, and I reflect on these memories so fondly in my heart and treasure all of them.
    You see, I had already provided a deposit and first month’s rent on a different apartment in the Horseheads area, as I was moving from the Painted Post area; the circumstances for the move were sad. At the time of my deposit, I had no idea of what apartment would become available at the apartment complex (I had inquired several times, but no details were available). As the time more closely approached for my move, I was provided the exact address. I went for a ride immediately to check things out. \n
    Ohholymoly, I was quite nervous when I saw the exact location as it was in the way back-back of the complex, and my apartment faced an unkempt wooded area (truly, I felt a hatchet murderer could be residing there). I had an unsafe feeling and I became very anxious and concerned. I then requested an alternate apartment from the real estate complex manager, but was told no other apartments were available and my request was denied--take it or leave it. This took place on a Wednesday or Thursday. On the Sunday afterwards, I drove to Mass as usual -- BUT after Mass then decided to take a drive and stop at my favorite supermarket, Miniers. As I was driving down Rt. 352 (this was unusual as I always drove the highway), I spotted vacancy signage at Strawberry Flats and pulled in. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I truly couldn’t and I began to tremble as I was so overcome with Strawberry Flats’ beauty. I phoned the number on the vacancy sign and received voicemail and left a message. But I did something more…. Which took a lot of nerve….maybe too much nerve on my part, but I decided to take a chance. \n
    There was a residence that stood out with gorgeous outside décor…..wreath on door, flowers on front terrace, very welcoming. My thought was, …..”if these folks like flowers and outdoor welcome decorations, they have to be wonderful human beings.”  I rang their doorbell and prayed.
    A man answered the door, and I immediately spewed my intent, my story, and my apologies, thinking the door might be closed on me. Ohno, not at all….. this man kept looking at my intently with no expression whatsoever as I told my story, didn’t flinch a bit, didn’t close the door in my face…. kept absorbing what I was saying to him. After I was done “telling my story,” this man paused  briefly and then said, “Kathy Honey, we have company.” OMG! Kathy immediately appeared, hugged me, and asked for my coat, and THEN, asked me if I liked wine. She invited me to sit down with her and her husband for a glass of wine and get to know each other. They introduced themselves to me as Lou and Kathy Holleran. I will remember this moment for the rest of my life. These lovely people could sense I had some sort of crisis in my life, but even more so, they trusted me. I can’t tell you what that meant to me. They didn’t know me at all, they were basing their judgment on a  brief encounter with me. If that’s not God, nothing is. \n
    Anthony Mosso returned my phone call first thing Monday morning. He was ever so gracious to me (as he has been since that day forward) and invited me in that same day to see the vacant, available apartment. We made arrangements for me to drive to the apartment directly after I got out of work. Tracy met me there as she was finishing up work in the apartment’s kitchen for the day. She was an angel to me, and the overwhelming feeling of peace when I met with her in the apartment was beyond words. I knew this was meant to me. I wrote my deposit check immediately. My life suddenly took on a new beginning and a whole new meaning. Our Dear Lord had tapped the Mosso family to be saviors in my life.
    That was eight years ago….. and in those eight years, the Mosso family has been a gorgeous focal point in my life. I have met and gotten to know each of the family members. They are beautiful people who have taken care of me in all of my needs at the apartment, no matter what, down to the silly but important things to me of changing light bulbs which I can’t reach (even with a ladder). Even more so, they have become my friends which is so especially awesome and blessed. The Mosso’s have always been and always will be a bright shining light in my life, both professionally AND personally. Whether it be a phone call, a lovely email, or a brief encounter in my driveway if I arrive home from work early, these exchanges have always been so reaffirming to me of what humanity is all about. In a world that sometimes seems stuck in negativity, the Mosso family’s true hearts and positive bias is just what the doctor ordered! \n
    I’m a blest woman because of the beautiful and blessed Mosso family. I thank God each and every day that He brought me to this family…. and residence….. and that I am HOME!

All of the neighbors are very friendly as well and the whole neighborhood usually gets together a few times a year. We are thoroughly enjoying Strawberry Flats and are very, very pleased here.
